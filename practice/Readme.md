## Overview

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning where algorithms are inspired by the structure and function of the brain, known as artificial neural networks. These models have achieved remarkable success in various domains, especially for tasks like:

- **Image Recognition** (e.g., classifying images from datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10)
- **Natural Language Processing** (e.g., text generation, sentiment analysis)
- **Speech Recognition** (e.g., converting speech to text)

## Tasks and Implementations

This repository includes the following deep-learning tasks and implementations:

- **Basic Neural Network Models for Classification**
  - Implement basic neural network models for simple classification tasks.
  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Image Recognition**
  - Use CNNs for image classification tasks, such as recognizing digits from MNIST and objects from CIFAR-10.

- **Activation Functions Demonstrations**
  - Visualizations and explanations of activation functions like:
    - **Sigmoid**
    - **Tanh**
    - **Softmax**
    - **ReLU**
      
- **Ecommerce-Order Accuracy Prediction using Deep Learning**
- Used tensorflow for building sequential model
- Performed One-hot Encoding on some columns
- Performed map() encoding on data with less cardinality
