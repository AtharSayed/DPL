# Practice Ground for Deep Learning

This repository contains various deep learning implementations and exercises that have been used for practice and learning. Happy learning!

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning where algorithms are inspired by the structure and function of the brain, known as artificial neural networks. These models are particularly effective in tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Tasks and Implementations:
- Basic neural network models for classification
- Convolutional neural networks for image recognition (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10)

## Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary libraries, such as TensorFlow and Keras.
3. Explore and run the code in the respective task directories.

```bash
# Install required libraries
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
