# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a simple feed-forward neural network built with TensorFlow. The model is trained and evaluated using TensorFlow's high-level API, Keras.

## Introduction

In this project, we use the MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9). The goal is to create a neural network model to predict the digit labels based on the input images.

We preprocess the data, build a simple neural network, and evaluate the model's performance on a test set.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
